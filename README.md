# MCx86

Emulates the future circuit implementation of a x86 processor built in Minecraft.

It is used both as a template to build the circuit, and to check if the algorithms and design work.

The input program is built using [MCx86](https://github.com/Keluaa/MCx86-Transassembler).

This is a work in progress.
